# Welcome to Python Blog using Django!

The purpose of this Python Blog project, is to execute Django framework setup then slowly add routes and applications.

Technically I use this approach to learn Python MVC and to become well-versed in Python while adding new features. In the next commits we will see bigger improvements. Follow this repo and learn with me while building this simple zero to hero project!
